# Advent of Code 2024

I use Python ([PyPy](https://pypy.org/)) to compete for global leaderboard positions.

The committed Python code is what I end up with after solving the 2nd part of each puzzle.

It's probably not pretty...

#### Prolog

I also write some solutions in [SWI Prolog 9.2](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) for fun (not for the leaderboard).

They are run from the command line like so:
```bash
swipl -O -t halt -g main 13.pl < 13.in
```
